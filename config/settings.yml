# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)
project_goal: 500
# If you want to edit the FAQ, head over to app/views/preorder/homepage/_faqs.html.erb

# This'll be both the page title (<title></title>) and the name in the header
product_name: "Carvoyant"

# An image showcasing your product -- it'll show up when you pin your product
# It should be in app/assets/images
product_image_path: "carvoyant-product-image.png"

# The message on the preorder page, Lockitron's 
value_proposition: "Your Car. Your Data. Your Control. Easy"

# Stats settings

# On Lockitron, it's "backers"
primary_stat: "jumpstarters"
# This'll show up in the tweet as, "I'm forker number ..."

ships: "First batch ships in March 2013"

# On Lockitron, it's "Reserve Now"
call_to_action: "Reserve Now"
# On Lockitron, this is "Only $149 for a limited time"

# The paragraph below the price. You'd probably say something about how you're not going to charge them before it ships (so it's less risky).
dont_give_them_a_reason_to_say_no: "No charge today! Jumpstarter pre-orders on our available hardware help Carvoyant drive everyoneâ€™s cost down as we extend the features already in place. Just before shipping we confirm your order, finish payment then send your Carvoyant enabled device."

# Social Stuff
facebook_app_id: "1234567890"
# Tweets are prefixed with "I'm #{Settings.primary_stat} number X for #{Settings.product_name}"
# Maybe mention something about your product vision -- e.g. "to replace keys with my phone"
tweet_text: "to get my car data under my control"

# Google Analytics
google_id: "UA-29603671-2"

# If you want to change the images for the key points (e.g. "Kickstarter is not a store")
# They're in app/assets/images/#{pointer_number}-background.png
# So, the first key point, it's at app/assets/images/1-background.png
# Alternatively, change it up in app/assets/stylesheets/homepage/key_points.css.scss
