          <summary>What will you do with my data?</summary>
          <p>Here's where Carvoyant will blow away the competition...your data is your's!  You opt in to share certain aspects of your data with specific vendors.  Therefore, you can TELL vendors when you need their service...no spam - EVER!  We will not sell you data.

          <summary class=''>How much are the data charges after the first year?</summary>
          <p>We are offering free data charges for the first year as a part of this jumpstarter program and to reward you for being an early adopter.  We are using jumpstarter to help bring everyone’s cost down.  The most the data plan will cost you is $4.99/month, however, we expect enough interest to enable Carvoyant to quickly drive down this cost.  If you choose to have a car dealer ‘sponsor’ your relationship we may be able to get the cost to $0.</p>

          <p>You can scan and email, or mail, or fax, your service records to Carvoyant. This is still a beta service, but we will digitize these records and have then available on your account for your review.  In time, our system will track what was done historically based on these records to help you better know what will need to be done, should be done, or is still under warranty!          </p>

          <p>Carvoyant provides our platform directly to consumers better manage the maintenance of their vehicle and want to get their car connected.  We are also providing our platform to various service providers in the automotive industry.  One or the early pathways into the industry is through car dealer service centers.  Today, a car dealer will cover the upfront and recurring data cost for Carvoyant in exchange for the right to co-brand your login screen and be the first to respond to your vehicle’s service needs.</p>
